With **Starknet Blinks**, we've developed a feature that converts Starknet-based actions (such as transactions, contract interactions, or layer-2 scaling operations) into easily shareable, metadata-rich links, optimized for platforms like Twitter. These "Blinks" contain essential metadata, including wallet addresses, transaction amounts, timestamps, and contract execution details. When shared on Twitter, these links generate dynamic, informative previews, making it simple for users to engage with Starknet actions directly from their timeline.

### Workflow:

**1. Starknet Action Execution:**
   - A user initiates an action on Starknet, such as sending tokens, executing a smart contract, or performing a transaction within the Starknet ecosystem. This action is captured through the Starknet transaction interface or smart contract interaction.

**2. Metadata Extraction:**
   - After the action is completed, key metadata related to the Starknet transaction is extracted. This includes transaction IDs, wallet addresses, token amounts, and timestamps.
   - For smart contract interactions, additional metadata such as the contract address, the executed function, and any passed parameters are also captured.

**3. Creation of Starknet Blink:**
   - The extracted metadata is then used to generate a Starknet Blink. This is a unique URL that bundles all the essential details of the Starknet action and encodes it in a way that is easy to share across social platforms, particularly on Twitter.

**4. Social Media Integration:**
   - The Starknet Blink URL is designed to integrate seamlessly with Twitter’s rich metadata preview capabilities. When a user shares the link, Twitter automatically generates a detailed preview of the Starknet action, showcasing important details such as the token amount, wallet addresses, transaction timestamp, and smart contract address. This enhances the visibility of Starknet activities and fosters transparency.

**5. Shareable Link:**
   - The Starknet Blink is now ready to be shared with a single click. It is fully optimized for social media, ensuring a clean and informative visual preview that makes it easy for others to understand the Starknet action. This allows the community to share insights, highlight transactions, and promote Starknet’s growing ecosystem with minimal effort.
